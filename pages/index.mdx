# Welcome to ChainRaizer Documentation

ChainRaizer is a decentralized protocol that enables private equity investment on the blockchain. By tokenizing private equity shares, we make private market investments more accessible, liquid, and transparent. Our protocol bridges the gap between traditional private equity and decentralized finance, allowing investors to participate in high-growth opportunities with lower barriers to entry.
