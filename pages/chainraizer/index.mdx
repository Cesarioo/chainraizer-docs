## ðŸ“‹ Executive Summary

We are sometime asked to summarize ChainRaizer in a few words, here they are: ChainRaizer is a DeFi protocol tokenizing private equity shares with 1:1 conversion, to make them accessible, liquid and transparent for everyone. Here are the benefits:

<Comparison 
  title="Accessibility"
  traditional="You'll need to commit a minimum of 100k$ to invest in any private equity deal and have a network of investors to get the deal."
  web3="Thanks to tokenization, you can now invest as little as 1$ and get access to a wide range of private equity deals accross the network."
/>

<Comparison 
  title="Liquidity"
  traditional="Private equity investments typically lock capital for 5-10 years with limited exit options"
  web3="Our protocol creates a secondary market for tokenized shares, providing unprecedented liquidity and flexibility"
/>

<Comparison 
  title="Transparency"
  traditional="The private equity market often lacks transparency in valuations and operations"
  web3="ChainRaizer leverages blockchain technology to ensure full transparency and auditability of all transactions and operations"
/>


## âš¡ Key Protocol Features

How are we able to provide such a service, and what does tokenization has to do with it? Tokenization is basically a set of "smart contracts" that allows indisputed finality. Today, the barrier to entry in Web2 is so high because private equity firms have to deal with lawyers every steps of the way to ensure your investment is tracked.

Using smart contracts with a fixed set of rules on a traceable blockchain, we can automate the paperwork and make the process faster and cheaper.



- **Smart Contract-Based Tokenization**: each transaction made with the token has top notch tracability and only responds to smart contract rules.
- **Strong Compliance**: strong compliance always ensure 1:1 conversion between shares and their token representation.
- **Interoperability**: each token is created with interoperability in mind, so they can be used on CEXs, DEXs, in DeFi and on all blockchains. 
- **Governance Framework**: each token has its own DAO, enabling representativity on shareholders meetings.
