# Core Values 

When companies write about values, it is often very boring. We try to make it interesting here, as you'll be able to know our thought process behind the app and what features will be deployed in the years to come.

## Maximum On-Chain Presence

We truly, deeply believe in the power of blockchain technology and commit to maximizing on-chain operations:

<div className="mt-6">
<Feature icon={Code2}>**Full On-Chain Logic**: Our protocol's core functionality lives entirely on the blockchain, without any proxy contracts.</Feature>
<Feature icon={Eye}>**Verifiable Operations**: Every transaction, decision, and change is recorded on-chain visible to everyone.</Feature>
<Feature icon={Shield}>**Minimal Off-Chain Dependencies**: We continuously work to reduce reliance on centralized systems</Feature>
<Feature icon={Rocket}>**Smart Contract Automation**: Replacing traditional processes with trustless, automated solutions</Feature>
</div>

## Radical Decentralization

Following the path of on-chain presence, our target is to build an autonomous and decentralized protocol built and owned by a community.

<div className="mt-6">
<Feature icon={Network}>**Self-Governing Protocol**: Building systems that can operate independently of central authorities, becoming a true Decentralized Autonomous Organisation. </Feature>
<Feature icon={Users}>**Community-Driven Development**: Users knows what are the best for them. We want to let them decide the future of the protocol.</Feature>
<Feature icon={Shield}>**Distributed Architecture**: Absolutely no single point of failure or control, to maximize trust and adoption.</Feature>
<Feature icon={Rocket}>**Progressive Decentralization**: In order to drive adoption and expansion of the market, we provide a clear roadmap to full protocol autonomy.</Feature>
</div>

/>

## Ultimate Transparency

In order to build trust, we will need utmost transparency making it a clear feature of the protocol

<div className="mt-6">
<Feature icon={Code2}>**Open Source Development**: Most of our code is public, auditable, and community-reviewable</Feature>
<Feature icon={Eye}>**Real-Time Information**: All protocol metrics and operations are publicly visible on the blockchain</Feature>
<Feature icon={Users}>**Clear Communication**: Regular updates on development, challenges, and progress</Feature>
<Feature icon={Network}>**Transparent Governance**: All decision-making processes will be public and verifiable</Feature>
</div>

## Industry Empowerment

We do not believe other protocols are competition. Contrary, we want to build with them to they can integrate our solution:

<div className="mt-6">
<Feature icon={Code2}>**Open Innovation**: APIs and documentation that enable others to build on our protocol</Feature>
<Feature icon={Users}>**Community Contributions**: Framework for community members to propose and implement improvements</Feature>
<Feature icon={Rocket}>**Shared Success**: Incentive structures that reward community participation</Feature>
<Feature icon={Shield}>**Educational Resources**: Comprehensive materials to help users understand and contribute</Feature>
</div>

## Technical Excellence

Our commitment to technical excellence means:

<div className="mt-6">
<Feature icon={Shield}>**Security First**: Rigorous security practices and regular audits</Feature>
<Feature icon={Rocket}>**Scalable Architecture**: Building for future growth from day one</Feature>
<Feature icon={Network}>**Efficient Operations**: Optimizing for speed and cost-effectiveness</Feature>
<Feature icon={Code2}>**Continuous Innovation**: Always pushing the boundaries of what's possible</Feature>
</div>
