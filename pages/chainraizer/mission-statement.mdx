# Mission Statement ðŸŽ¯

ChainRaizer is a technology protocol built on blockchain, which does only one thing: the tokenization of private equity shares. A protocol is ensentially a suite of smart contracts which function independently of any human actions. Once the rules are set, everyone can use them and no one can change them. 

Born from the vision of making private equity more accessible and liquid, our contributors combines expertise in blockchain development, financial markets, and security infrastructure. 

## The Mission

ChainRaizer's mission is to propose private equity deals on the blockchain to allow for safe, traceable and liquid investments. We are dedicated to providing a secure and robust framework for everyone to access to private equity investments, which have historically been restricted to a select group of institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals.

Through our protocol, we aim to transform how private equity operates by:

<div className="mt-6">
<Feature icon={Users}>
  **Democratizing Access**: Breaking down traditional barriers to entry by enabling fractional ownership of private equity investments through tokenization. This allows a broader range of investors to participate in opportunities that were previously out of reach.
</Feature>

<Feature icon={Workflow}>
  **Creating New Market Dynamics**: Establishing a vibrant secondary market for private equity investments, addressing the fundamental challenge of illiquidity in traditional private equity. This innovation enables investors to manage their portfolios more dynamically and access liquidity when needed.
</Feature>

<Feature icon={Gauge}>
  **Enhancing Market Efficiency**: Leveraging blockchain technology to automate and streamline processes that have historically been manual and time-consuming. From investment execution to dividend distribution, our protocol aims to reduce friction and costs while increasing operational efficiency.
</Feature>

<Feature icon={Globe}>
  **Fostering Global Participation**: Building a borderless platform that connects investors and opportunities worldwide, creating a more inclusive and diverse private equity ecosystem that transcends geographical limitations.

## Our Vision

In the next decade, we envision a world where private equity investment has been fundamentally transformed by blockchain technology. Through ChainRaizer's protocol:

### A New Financial Paradigm emerges
Private equity will no longer be the exclusive domain of institutional investors. Just as the internet democratized information and e-commerce transformed retail, blockchain technology through ChainRaizer will make private equity accessible to millions of investors worldwide. We see a future where:

<div className="mt-6">
<Feature icon={DollarSign}> **There are no minimum to invest:** Investment minimums of $100,000 become $1, enabling broader participation.</Feature>
<Feature icon={Clock}>**The investment becomes liquid:** 7-10 year lockup periods become flexible exit opportunities through our secondary market.</Feature>
<Feature icon={Zap}>**A major part of finance will be automated**: we believe it is already the case through DeFi, where Complex legal processes are automated through smart contracts, reducing costs by 99%.</Feature>
<Feature icon={Activity}>**Investments decisions can be made in seconds, not weeks**: enabling for a better, fairer market.</Feature>
</div>

### The Evolution of Private Markets
The private equity market of 2035 will be unrecognizable from today:

As the tokenized private equity market matures, it will grow to rival traditional public markets in both size and significance, fundamentally reshaping the investment landscape. The way investors interact with private equity will transform dramatically - portfolio rebalancing, which has historically been a heavy process in private equity, will become as routine and straightforward as it is in trading memecoins today.

Geographic boundaries that have long constrained private equity investments will cease to exist. Investors from any country will be able to access opportunities worldwide, creating a truly global and interconnected marketplace. This democratization will be further enhanced by the continuous nature of blockchain technology, enabling round-the-clock trading of private equity tokens. 

### Technological Integration
We're building towards a future with:

<div className="mt-6">
<Feature icon={Network}>**Institutional Grade Security:** for equity tokens to become a standard part of investment portfolios</Feature>
<Feature icon={Workflow}>**User Experience Focus:** because transacing on blockchain should not feel different from any other app.</Feature>
<Feature icon={Shield}>**Strong Compliance:** some dare to say crypto is far west, we are proving them wrong.</Feature>
<Feature icon={Activity}>**Real time liquidity:** Real-time performance tracking and valuations are the norm, not the exception</Feature>
