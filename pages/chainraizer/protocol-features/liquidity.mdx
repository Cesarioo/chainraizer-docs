# Liquidity & Interoperability

## Breaking Down Barriers

Traditional private equity suffers from a fundamental limitation: illiquidity. Investments are typically locked for years, with limited options for early exit. ChainRaizer transforms this paradigm by making tokenized shares freely tradeable across the blockchain ecosystem.

## Comprehensive Market Access

Our protocol ensures maximum liquidity by integrating with multiple trading venues and DeFi protocols:

### Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)
We maintain deep liquidity pools on major DEX platforms:
- **Automated Market Makers**: Integration with Uniswap, SushiSwap, and other leading DEXs
- **Order Book DEXs**: Support for limit orders and advanced trading features
- **Liquidity Mining**: Incentive programs to ensure consistent market depth
- **Cross-Chain DEXs**: Access to trading on multiple blockchain networks

### Centralized Exchanges (CEXs)
Strategic partnerships with regulated exchanges provide:
