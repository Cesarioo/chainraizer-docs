### Getting Started

To begin testing the Raizer protocol, you'll first need to connect your cryptocurrency wallet to our testing environment. Once connected, you can claim your test Soul Bound Token (SBT) which will grant you access to the platform's features. With your SBT in hand, you'll be able to explore our test investment opportunities and participate in governance decisions in a risk-free environment.

### Community Feedback

Community participation is crucial for the success of our testing phase. We encourage all testers to actively report any bugs or issues they encounter through our GitHub repository. 

Additionally, we welcome suggestions for protocol improvements and feature enhancements from our community members. To facilitate open discussion and collaboration, we've created dedicated channels where testers can engage in conversations about their experiences, share insights, and discuss potential improvements with other community members.
