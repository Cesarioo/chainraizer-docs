## Decentralization Phase

### Community Control
<div className="mt-6">
<Feature icon={Vote}>**Full DAO Governance**: Community-driven protocol parameters and usage of protocol funds</Feature>
<Feature icon={Building2}>**DeFi Ecosystem**: Complete integration with decentralized finance</Feature>
<Feature icon={Network}>**Open Markets**: Permissioned investment listings and secondary trading</Feature>
</div>

### Protocol Sustainability

The protocol's economic model ensures long-term sustainability through community-managed treasury, self-sustaining fee structures, and decentralized revenue distribution. All protocol parameters are governed by the community, creating a truly autonomous system that can evolve and adapt to market needs.

### Future Development

The protocol's evolution is now entirely in the hands of the community. Through open governance and collaborative development, token holders can propose and implement improvements, expand the ecosystem, and shape the future of decentralized private equity investment. The original development team becomes just one of many contributors to the ecosystem.
