## Decentralization Phase

### Community Control
<div className="mt-6">
<Feature icon={Vote}>**Full DAO Governance**: Community-driven platform parameters and usage of platform funds</Feature>
<Feature icon={Building2}>**Digital Finance Ecosystem**: Complete integration with decentralized finance</Feature>
<Feature icon={Network}>**Open Markets**: Community-managed investment listings and secondary trading</Feature>
</div>

### Platform Sustainability

The platform's economic model ensures long-term sustainability through community-managed treasury, self-sustaining fee structures, and decentralized revenue distribution. All platform parameters are governed by the community, creating a truly autonomous system that can evolve and adapt to market needs.

### Future Development

The platform's evolution is now entirely in the hands of the community. Through open governance and collaborative development, community members can propose and implement improvements, expand the ecosystem, and shape the future of decentralized private equity investment. The original development team becomes just one of many contributors to the ecosystem.
