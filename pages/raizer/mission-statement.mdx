# Mission Statement ðŸŽ¯

Raizer is a blockchain protocol with a clear focus: allowing anyone to bet on the IPO price of private equity companies. Our protocol operates through smart contracts that run independently once deployed. The rules are transparent and immutable, ensuring a trustless system for all participants.

Our core contributors combine deep expertise in blockchain technology, financial markets, and security infrastructure - united by the mission of making private equity accessible to everyone.

## The Mission

Raizer brings the performance of private equity to the blockchain, creating a secure, traceable, and liquid investment ecosystem. We're removing the traditional barriers that have limited private equity to institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals.

Here's how we're transforming private equity:
