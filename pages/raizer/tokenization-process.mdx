# Tokenization Process

## Investment Structure

Raizer's tokenization process begins with the acquisition of shares through authorized brokers in the private equity market. These shares are then professionally managed and held by a regulated Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM) in Luxembourg, ensuring compliance with European financial regulations.

### Value Structure
The tokenization is facilitated through a British Virgin Islands (BVI) entity that issues digital shares with a 1:1 backing against the underlying shares. This means that each digital asset represents a direct economic interest in the corresponding share held by the AIFM.

The BVI entity maintains a binding contractual relationship with the Luxembourg AIFM, ensuring that digital asset holders' rights are properly protected. Each digital share is fully backed by the corresponding traditional share, creating a transparent and secure value proposition.

When the underlying company proceeds with an IPO, digital asset holders have guaranteed legal rights to trade their assets at the corresponding IPO valuation. This structure provides a clear and legally enforceable value proposition while maintaining regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions.
