# Liquidity & Interoperability

Private equity represents one of the most attractive asset classes in the market. However, its potential is limited by a significant constraint: illiquidity. Traditional private equity investments are typically locked for extended periods, often 5-10 years, with minimal exit options. Raizer addresses this limitation by enabling these assets to be freely traded across the digital finance ecosystem.

The Raizer platform transforms private equity investments through digitization, enabling seamless integration with the broader digital finance ecosystem. Our platform's open architecture allows any financial platform to integrate these digitized assets, creating a network effect where each integration enhances overall market liquidity.

## Comprehensive Market Access

Raizer functions as a platform layer rather than an exchange. Our digital systems enable private equity trading while remaining exchange-agnostic. Trading primarily occurs through two main channels:

### Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)
Our integration with leading decentralized exchange platforms enables:
