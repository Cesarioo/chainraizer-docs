# Liquidity & Interoperability

Private equity represents one of the most attractive asset classes in the market. However, its potential is limited by a significant constraint: illiquidity. Traditional private equity investments are typically locked for extended periods, often 5-10 years, with minimal exit options. Raizer addresses this limitation by enabling these assets to be freely traded across the blockchain ecosystem.

The Raizer protocol transforms private equity investments through tokenization, enabling seamless integration with the broader blockchain ecosystem. Our protocol's open architecture allows any blockchain platform to integrate these tokenized assets, creating a network effect where each integration enhances overall market liquidity.

## Comprehensive Market Access

Raizer functions as a protocol layer rather than an exchange platform. Our smart contracts enable private equity trading while remaining exchange-agnostic. Trading primarily occurs through two main channels:

### Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)
