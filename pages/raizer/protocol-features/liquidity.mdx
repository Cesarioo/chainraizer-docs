# Liquidity & Interoperability

Private Equity could be the best asset class. The only thing holding this status back is a fundamental limitation: illiquidity.  Investments are typically locked for (tens of) years, with limited options for early exit. Raizer transforms this paradigm by making tokenized shares freely tradeable across the blockchain ecosystem.

With that said, we created Raizer as a protocol capable of tokenizing this asset class, and make it live on its own terms in the blockchain. Any protocol can integrate these tokenized assets, as more integrations bring more liqudity.

## Comprehensive Market Access

Raizer is not built to be an exchange. Raizer is a set of smart-contracts allowing the trading of tokenized private equity. As we tend to focus on what we do best, we believe the trading of our tokenized shares will mostly happen on: 

### Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)
Through integration with leading DEXs like Uniswap and SushiSwap, investors can trade shares 24/7 in a completely permissionless way. The AMM model ensures there is always a price and ability to trade, regardless of the time or market conditions.

There, liquidity is maintained through the trading activity of the token: the more it will trade, the more revenues it will generate for liquidity providers, the more liquidity will be deployed. This creates a virtuous cycle where increased liquidity attracts more traders, which in turn attracts more liquidity providers.

### Centralized Exchanges (CEXs)
Centralized exchanges on the other hand will provide access to this asset class as a new product for their users: as they did with traditional tokenized shares in 2022. However, it did not last because of the strong lack of regulations over public shares. Such a regulatory framework is a native feature of the Raizer Protocol.

This will be an easy access for the retail investor, with easy on-ramp and UX. Professional traders can take advantage of advanced order types and sophisticated trading tools as well.
