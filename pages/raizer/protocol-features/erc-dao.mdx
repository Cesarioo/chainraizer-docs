# On-Chain Governance

## Decentralized Decision Making

Raizer implements a fully on-chain governance system that transforms traditional shareholder voting into a transparent, efficient, and decentralized process. Every corporate decision that traditionally requires shareholder approval is conducted through our DAO voting mechanism.
