# Digital Governance

## Decentralized Decision Making

Raizer implements a fully digital governance system that transforms traditional shareholder voting into a transparent, efficient, and decentralized process. Every corporate decision that traditionally requires shareholder approval is conducted through our DAO voting mechanism.

## Snapshot Voting System

Our governance system utilizes a snapshot mechanism that captures digital asset holdings at the exact moment a proposal is created. This ensures fair voting power distribution and prevents manipulation through last-minute asset purchases.
