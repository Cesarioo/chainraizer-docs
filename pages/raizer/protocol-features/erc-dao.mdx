# On-Chain Governance

## Decentralized Decision Making

Raizer implements a fully on-chain governance system that transforms traditional shareholder voting into a transparent, efficient, and decentralized process. Every corporate decision that traditionally requires shareholder approval is conducted through our DAO voting mechanism.

## Snapshot Voting System

### How Snapshot Voting Works

Our governance system utilizes a snapshot mechanism that captures token holdings at the exact moment a proposal is created:

1. **Proposal Creation**: When a new vote is initiated, the system automatically takes a snapshot of all token holdings
2. **Voting Power**: Voting rights are calculated based on token balance at snapshot time
3. **Vote Delegation**: Users can delegate their voting power to other addresses
4. **Vote Execution**: Results are automatically recorded and executed on-chain

### Key Benefits of Snapshot Voting
- **Prevents Vote Manipulation**: No buying power during active votes
- **Clear Record**: Exact voting power distribution at proposal time
- **Gas Efficient**: Vote delegation without token transfers
- **Transparent Process**: All actions visible on-chain

## Vote Delegation

Our system enables sophisticated delegation mechanisms:

### Delegation Features
- **Flexible Delegation**: Delegate to any address at any time
- **Multiple Options**: Self-voting or delegation to experts
- **Instant Updates**: Change delegation with immediate effect
- **Power Tracking**: Real-time view of delegated voting power

### Strategic Delegation
Users can choose their delegation strategy:
- **Direct Participation**: Vote on proposals directly
- **Expert Delegation**: Delegate to governance specialists
- **Split Delegation**: Distribute voting power across multiple delegates
- **Time-Based**: Change delegation based on proposal types
