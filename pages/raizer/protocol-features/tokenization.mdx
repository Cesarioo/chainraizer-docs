# Share Digitization

## Understanding Share Digitization

Digital assets created via the Raizer platform represent participation in the administration of private companies. This allows the digital asset to be tradeable against its market value when the company will become public. This transformation enables this participation to exist on our digital platform, providing enhanced transparency, liquidity and utility for those who want to bet on the IPO's price of a company.

Our platform enables any private equity participation to be represented as a digital asset while maintaining its original properties and gaining digital advantages: interoperability, liquidity, and utility.
