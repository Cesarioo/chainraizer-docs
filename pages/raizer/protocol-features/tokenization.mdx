# Share Tokenization

## Understanding Share Tokenization

Tokens emited via the Raizer protocol represent participation in the administration of private companies. This allows the token to be tradeable against its market value when the company will become public. This transformation enables this participation to exist on the blockchain, providing enhanced transparency, liqudity and utility for thoses who want to bet on the IPO's price of a company.

Our protocol enables any private equity participation to be represented as a digital token while maintaining its original properties and gaining blockchain advantages: interoperability, liquidity, and utility.
