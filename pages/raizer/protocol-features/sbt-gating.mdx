# Soul Bound Token (SBT) Gating

## Understanding SBT Access

Raizer implements a unique Soul Bound Token (SBT) system that ensures fair participation and decentralized token distribution while maintaining seamless protocol access. Unlike traditional gating mechanisms, our SBT system is designed to be inclusive while promoting healthy market dynamics.

  title="Automatic Access"
  description="Every wallet interacting with Raizer automatically receives a free SBT, ensuring zero friction for new participants while maintaining protocol security."
/>

## How It Works

### Automatic Distribution
Our protocol implements a frictionless onboarding process:

<div className="mt-6">
<Feature icon={Key}>**Zero-Cost Entry**: Free SBT for all participating wallets</Feature>
<Feature icon={Lock}>**Non-Transferable**: SBTs are bound to the receiving wallet</Feature>
<Feature icon={Rocket}>**Immediate Access**: Start using the protocol instantly</Feature>
</div>

### Level System

The SBT system features multiple levels that determine investment capabilities. Upon completing several quests, each level provides more advantages for each primary market entry. Advantages will depend on the specifics of the primary markets offered.

## Supply Decentralization

Our SBT system is designed to ensure fair token distribution through a comprehensive investment limits framework. Each SBT level comes with specific investment caps that determine how much a user can participate in primary market offerings. 

As users progress to higher levels, they unlock larger allocation amounts, creating a natural progression system. This tiered approach prevents any single entity from dominating the token supply, as investment capabilities are directly tied to a user's SBT level and engagement with the protocol. 

The result is a balanced and decentralized distribution of tokens across the participant base.

### Progressive Access
The system promotes active participation:
<div className="mt-6">
<Feature icon={Star}>**Starting Point**: Basic allocation rights for new users</Feature>
<Feature icon={Rocket}>**Growth Path**: Clear progression through engagement</Feature>
<Feature icon={Shield}>**Fair Distribution**: Prevents whale concentration</Feature>
</div>
