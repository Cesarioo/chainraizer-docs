# Soul Bound Token (SBT) Gating

## Understanding SBT Access

Raizer implements a unique Soul Bound Token (SBT) system that ensures fair participation and decentralized token distribution while maintaining seamless protocol access. Unlike traditional gating mechanisms, our SBT system is designed to be inclusive while promoting healthy market dynamics.

## How It Works

### Automatic Distribution
Our protocol implements a frictionless onboarding process:
- **Zero-Cost Entry**: Free SBT for all participating wallets
- **Automatic Issuance**: SBT sent automatically on first interaction
- **Non-Transferable**: SBTs are bound to the receiving wallet
- **Immediate Access**: Start using the protocol instantly

### Level System

The SBT system features multiple levels that determine investment capabilities:

- **Level 1**: Entry level access for new participants
- **Level 2**: Enhanced investment limits and features
- **Level 3**: Advanced trading capabilities
- **Level 4**: Premium access with maximum allocation rights

Each level provides:
- Different primary market allocation sizes
- Varied investment caps
- Specific protocol features access
- Unique governance rights

## Supply Decentralization

Our SBT system is designed to ensure fair token distribution:

### Investment Limits
- Each SBT level has specific investment caps
- Higher levels unlock larger allocation rights
- Prevents single entities from dominating supply
- Encourages broader market participation

### Progressive Access
The system promotes active participation:
- **Starting Point**: Basic allocation rights for new users
- **Growth Path**: Clear progression through engagement
- **Fair Distribution**: Prevents whale concentration
- **Community Focus**: Rewards active participants
