## How It Works

### Automatic Distribution
Our platform implements a frictionless onboarding process:

<div className="mt-6">
<Feature icon={Key}>**Zero-Cost Entry**: Free Access Token for all participating accounts</Feature>
<Feature icon={Lock}>**Non-Transferable**: Access Tokens are bound to the receiving account</Feature>
<Feature icon={Rocket}>**Immediate Access**: Start using the platform instantly</Feature>
</div>

### Level System

The Access Token system features multiple levels that determine investment capabilities. Upon completing several quests, each level provides more advantages for each primary market entry. Advantages will depend on the specifics of the primary markets offered.

## Supply Decentralization

Our Access Token system is designed to ensure fair digital asset distribution through a comprehensive investment limits framework. Each Access Token level comes with specific investment caps that determine how much a user can participate in primary market offerings. 

As users progress to higher levels, they unlock larger allocation amounts, creating a natural progression system. This tiered approach prevents any single entity from dominating the asset supply, as investment capabilities are directly tied to a user's Access Token level and engagement with the platform. 

The result is a balanced and decentralized distribution of digital assets across the participant base.

### Progressive Access
The system promotes active participation:
<div className="mt-6">
<Feature icon={Star}>**Starting Point**: Basic allocation rights for new users</Feature>
<Feature icon={Rocket}>**Growth Path**: Clear progression through engagement</Feature>
<Feature icon={Shield}>**Fair Distribution**: Prevents whale concentration</Feature>
</div>
