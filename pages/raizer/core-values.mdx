# Core Values 

Our values shape every aspect of Raizer's development. They guide our decisions, influence our roadmap, and define the features we'll introduce in the coming years.

## Maximum On-Chain Presence

We're committed to blockchain technology's potential, maximizing on-chain operations across our protocol:

<div className="mt-6">
<Feature icon={Code2}>**Full On-Chain Logic**: Our protocol's core functionality operates entirely on the blockchain.</Feature>
<Feature icon={Shield}>**Minimal Off-Chain Dependencies**: Our protocol systematically reduces reliance on centralized systems.</Feature>
</div>

## Radical Decentralization

Building on our commitment to on-chain operations, we're developing an autonomous, decentralized protocol owned and governed by its community:

<div className="mt-6">
<Feature icon={Network}>**No Single Frontend**: Anyone can build on top of Raizer's smart contract, to decentralize its access.</Feature>
<Feature icon={Users}>**Community-Driven Development**: Protocol improvements and changes are determined by those who use it most - our community.</Feature>
<Feature icon={Rocket}>**Progressive Decentralization**: Following a clear roadmap toward complete protocol autonomy while ensuring market growth.</Feature>
</div>
