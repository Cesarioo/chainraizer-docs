### Achieve True Decentralization

We are deeply committed to the complete decentralization of the Raizer Platform. Our vision extends beyond traditional organizational structures - today, anyone can already become an active contributor to the platform's development and governance. This open approach ensures that the platform's future is shaped by a diverse community of stakeholders rather than a centralized authority.
